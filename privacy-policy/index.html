    </p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
    <p>
      SnakePP does <strong>not</strong> request or require any runtime permissions from the device. The app functions locally on the user’s device and does not rely on network communication or third-party APIs.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      This application does not integrate any third-party SDKs, analytics services, ad networks, or cloud storage platforms. All functionality is self-contained and does not communicate with external servers.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      SnakePP is safe for users of all ages, including children under the age of 13. The app does not contain any violent content, inappropriate language, or access to online content. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Offline Functionality</h2>
    <p>
      The game is designed to work 100% offline. No internet connection is required at any time. The user experience is entirely local, ensuring high privacy and low resource usage.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      Since SnakePP does not handle any data, there are no risks associated with breaches, leaks, or unauthorized access. However, we recommend keeping your device secure and up-to-date to ensure optimal protection.
